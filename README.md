Hi there, I'm Toryn, a sixteen-year-old developer from the California redwoods. I am interested in all facets of computer science and design from frontend development with frameworks to low-level algorithm optimization. Feel free to explore my repositories, make some issues and open a few pull requests.

## 💡 Featured Projects
